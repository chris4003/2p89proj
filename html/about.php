					<h1> How it works </h1>
					<h2> Creating an event: </h2>
					<p>
						If you're an event coordinator and would like to advertise an event on the site, simply register with the site and start adding event information.  It's that simple!  If you just want to browse existing events, you don't need to sign up, just go to our home page and search.<br><br>

						Recurring events can be saved for convenience.  So, for example, if every Saturday is ladies night, you can set an event each week without adding each one individually.
					</p>

					<h2> Tags: </h2>
					<p>
						When events go down in your area, they're posted here and tagged with interest "tags".  You can use these tags to sort and search for events that are tailored to you !  To search for events by tag, use the search feature on our <a href="index.php">home page</a>.
					</p>
					<h2> Something Else: </h2>
					<p>
						Lorem ipsum and stuff.
